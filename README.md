# Construction-Dewatering-Design-including-settlements-on-neighborhood-buildings
This repository refers to the dewatering design during construction and calculates the settlements of neighboring buildings.
It concerns a real project that there are important buildings around that have to be protected during the construction dewatering phase.
The main soil material is silty sand. 
For this, two methodologies depending on cohesion and cohesionless (Schemertmann) soil formulas are used.
Complete Excel sheets calculations are provided
It calculates the required pumping discharge quantity Q, to succeed the desirable water drawdown, modeling the excavation as one big well.
Then using the superposition method of each separate well calculates the drawdown at internal the project points and at external buildings points at their foundation level.
At the building points and the fooundation levels, the stresses before and after the dewatering and the settlements and differential settlements are calculated.
The differential settlements are compared to the standards.
Also, it calculates the dewatering lines sizes, the pumps well filter pack and screen.
Moreover, the Plaxis program used for numerical analysis, as is noted in the report.
Hope it will be helpful for engineers dealing with similar projects.
Any proposal or correction will be well accepted.
